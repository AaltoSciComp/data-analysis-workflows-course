    "Python is a high-level language.  It is really designed as a solid programming language first, but is also very often used as a \"glue\" language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is designed to make sense, which is surprisingly important long-term.  Luckily this sensibility also applies to most of the big libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides the flexibility to get things done quickly, but also the easy access to lower level languages.  For example, if you are calling the some library which calls CUDA libraries to do machine learning stuff, it doesn't matter how efficient you little bit of Python is - and it will probably be even more efficient since you won't cut corners at things like data processing and input/output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has this easter egg as to what make things \"Pythonic\".  It is a pretty good thing to use in all of your own life, too:"
