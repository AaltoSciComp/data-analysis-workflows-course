Software installation
=====================

This course will use [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/)
as the base installation platform as it can provide both Python and R
installations for multiple operating systems.

All of the required software is included in the course's
`environment.yml <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AaltoSciComp/data-analysis-workflows-course/master/environment.yml>`_:

.. literalinclude:: ../environment.yml
