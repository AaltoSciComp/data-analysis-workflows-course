*******************************************************
Different resources involved in data analysis pipelines
*******************************************************

Modern data analysis pipelines can be very expensive computationally. In order
to scale these pipelines up, we'll need to first understand the resources that
these pipelines require. These resources are:

1. Processors (CPUs)
2. Memory (RAM)
3. Storage space
4. Time

Let's look at them one by one.

Processors as a resource
