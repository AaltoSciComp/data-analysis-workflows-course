# Homework instructions

Each homework exercise is worth 6 points.  To pass the course, you
need 50% of the total maximum points.

For each exercise, you are free to choose whether you use R or Python,
however, at least 25% of your total points must come from exercises
done with the other language.  That is, you can't use only R or only
Python exclusively.
