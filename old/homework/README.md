# Homework instructions

Each homework exercise is worth 6 points.  To pass the course, you
need 50% of the total maximum points.

For each exercise, you are free to choose whether you use R or Python,
however, at least 3 points are required for both R and Python
solutions.  That is, you can't use only R or only Python exclusively.

For example, with 4 homework exercises, you need at least 12 points to
pass the course.  Thus making 3 exercises with Python and getting 3
points each, and one exercise with R getting 3 points, would be a bare
minimum to pass.
