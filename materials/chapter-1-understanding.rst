Chapter 1: Understanding data analysis workflows
================================================

================================================

Data analysis workflows are commonly split to three to four steps:


1. Data perparation and loading
2. Modeling
3. Model evaluation
4. Presentation

From now on will call this the **data analysis pipeline**.

Data preparation and loading represents the process of preparing your
data into a format that is usable for analysis. One might think that
this is a very simple procedure, but in reality it is usually the most
time intensive part. Without proper data there can be no data analysis
and data is rarely provided in a format that is perfect to the task at
hand. Cleaning up data, combining it with other data and creating a
efficient data pipeline depends heavily on the task at hand and thus
it requires a lot of manual effort. Badly done data preparation will
also propagate throughout the data analysis pipeline.
